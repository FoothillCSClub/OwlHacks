# OwlHacks Fall 2017 -- Schedule

### November 10th:

 * 10 AM: Doors are opened and hackathon organizers will begin to sign
   in all RSVP'd hackers.

 * 11 AM: the hackathon actually starts, official announcements are
   made, and the team-building fest begins. This is a great time to meet
   people who share your interests in project ideas and form a team if
   you don't have one.

 * Noon: Lunch. We will have pre-made wraps for all who are hungry.

 * 6 PM: Dinner. Dinner consists of pizza. Lots of pizza. Did I mention
   there's pizza?

 * 9 PM: OwlHacks is closed for the night.

### November 11th:

 * 10 AM: OwlHacks reopens it's doors for the second day.

 * Noon: Lunch. The menu is the same as on the previous day.

 * 5 PM: Dinner. MORE PIZZA!

 * 6 PM: Judging begins. Judges from the Foothill Computer Science
   faculty will come around to where you are working and evaluate your
   work. Once they've had a look, feel free to have a look at what other
   teams have done.

 * 7 PM: Awards presented. Judges will present the awards to the winning
   teams and briefly describe what they thought was
   interesting/inspiring about their projects.

 * 8 PM: Cleanup. While hackers are not required to assist in tearing
   down and packing away the hackathon, any help is always appreciated.
