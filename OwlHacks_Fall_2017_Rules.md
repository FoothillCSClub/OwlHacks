   people who share your interests in project ideas and form a team if
   you don't have one.

   faculty will come around to where you are working and evaluate your
   work. Once they've had a look, feel free to have a look at what other
   teams have done.

 * 7 PM: Awards presented. Judges will present the awards to the winning
   teams and briefly describe what they thought was
   interesting/inspiring about their projects.

   down and packing away the hackathon, any help is always appreciated.

## Rules:

1. Foothill Computer Science Club officers may not enter judge-able projects.

2. Do not bring in pre-made code and enter it in the competition.  You
   can use publicly accessible APIs, libraries, etc, but all of your
   actual project development should take place during the hackathon.

3. All prize-winners will receive an official certificate signed by the
   judges.

4. Do not be a jerk. You know what this means; if you didn't, you
   couldn't have made it this far in life. Don't do it, I'm warning you.

5. There are several prize categories:
    * Best in Show:
       * 1st Place,
       * 2nd Place &
       * 3rd Place
